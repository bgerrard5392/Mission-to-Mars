# Mission to Mars


## Project Overview
To infinity, and beyond! The purpose of this Project was to scrape data from various websites related to Mars using python. then used MondoDB, Flask and Bootstrap to create a local html 

In this module I created a web page for a Data Journalist named Dana using JavaScript's visual functionality to provided a dynamic analysis on UFO sightings around the world. 

With Java Script I was able to build a table where users can filter the UFO sightings data by date, city, state, country and type of sigthting. From there I created an HTML page where I display Dana's article on UFO sightings as well as the table with the easy to use filter.  

Build an APP to scrape data from websites for our mission to mars projects and then create an HTML page to show our findings.


## Step 1 using Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb:

1. Write Code is written that retrieves the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.
2. Have full-resolution images of the hemispheres are added to the dictionary. 
3. Titles for the hemisphere images are added to the dictionary. 
4. Create a list containing the dictionary of the full-resolution image URL string and title for each hemisphere image. 

## Step 2 creating the HTML and creating a function to scrape the images with the scraping.py file:

1. Create a scraping.py file contains code that retrieves the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
2. Make a Mongo database is updated to contain the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
3. Create the index.html file contains code that will display the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
4.After the scraping has been completed, the web app contains all the information from this module and the full-resolution images and titles for the four hemisphere images.




Finally, The webpage is mobile-responsive. Add Bootstrap 3 components are used to style the webpage.
